# Keras üöÄ Vs Pytorch üí™

In this lecture, we will explore two widely-used deep learning frameworks: [Keras](https://keras.io/) and [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/). While both are powerful tools for building neural networks, they offer
distinct features and approaches that make them suitable for different tasks and user preferences.

Our task today involves implementing a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) with one hidden layer to tackle the MNIST digit classification problem. MNIST is a well-known
dataset of handwritten digits, making it an ideal choice for demonstrating classification tasks due to its simplicity and availability.<br><br>


Following are some differences between Keras and Pytorch:

|                 | **PyTorch** | **Keras**|
|-----------------|-------------|----------|
| **Target Audience**        | Researchers, experienced developers with need for flexibility              | Beginners, quick prototypers, industry practitioners|
| **Flexibility**            | High; dynamic computation graph allows for custom operations and research  | Moderate; pre-built layers offer speed but limit some customization|
| **Community & Ecosystem**  | Strong research community support, backed by Facebook (Meta)               | Extensive enterprise adoption, part of TensorFlow ecosystem, backed by Google|
| **Deployment Capabilities**| Supports model exporting for integration into production systems           | Leverages TensorFlow's ecosystem for scalable and efficient deployment|
| **Documentation & Resources** | Advanced materials and documentation for experienced developers         | Beginner-friendly resources and tutorials|
| **Use Cases**                | Experimental projects, cutting-edge research, complex models             | Industry applications, rapid prototyping, enterprise use|
| **Scalability**|Handles large-scale deployments with dynamic computation graph performance | Efficient scaling via TensorFlow's distributed training capabilities|


## Usage üìù
The `.ipynb` notebook it's ready for start, you just need to run it using your virtualenv or just upload it on
[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
