When sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it encounters tiny molecules of gases such as nitrogen and oxygen. These molecules scatter the light in all directions, but they scatter shorter (blue) wavelengths more than longer (red) wavelengths. This is known as Rayleigh scattering.\\n\\nAs a result of this scattering, the blue light is dispersed throughout the atmosphere, giving the sky its blue appearance. The red light, on the other hand, passes through the atmosphere mostly unscattered, which is why we can see the sun as a bright red ball during sunrise and sunset.\\n\\nThe blue color of the sky can also be affected by other factors such as air pollution, dust, and water vapor. For example, when there is a lot of air pollution in the atmosphere, it can scatter the light in different ways, giving the sky a more hazy or yellowish appearance. Similarly, the presence of dust and water vapor can also affect the way the light is scattered, resulting in a different color of the sky.\\n\\nIt's worth noting that the blue color of the sky is not always constant and can vary depending on the time of day, weather conditions, and location. For example, during sunrise and sunset, the sky can take on hues of red, orange, and pink due to the angle of the sunlight and the scattering of light by the atmosphere.\",\"done\":true,\"done_reason\":\"stop\",\"context\":[518,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,11008,338,278,14744,7254,29973,518,29914,25580,29962,13,13,1576,14744,5692,7254,1363,310,263,27791,265,2000,9596,280,1141,14801,292,29889,1932,6575,4366,24395,11563,29915,29879,25005,29892,372,2094,1309,2153,21577,13206,21337,310,330,2129,1316,408,21767,307,1885,322,288,28596,29889,4525,13206,21337,14801,278,3578,297,599,18112,29892,541,896,14801,20511,313,9539,29897,281,6447,1477,29879,901,1135,5520,313,1127,29897,281,6447,1477,29879,29889,910,338,2998,408,9596,280,1141,14801,292,29889,13,13,2887,263,1121,310,445,14801,292,29892,278,7254,3578,338,29106,287,10106,278,25005,29892,6820,278,14744,967,7254,10097,29889,450,2654,3578,29892,373,278,916,1361,29892,14517,1549,278,25005,11149,443,1557,2620,287,29892,607,338,2020,591,508,1074,278,6575,408,263,11785,2654,8287,2645,6575,29878,895,322,6575,842,29889,13,13,1576,7254,2927,310,278,14744,508,884,367,15201,491,916,13879,1316,408,4799,21180,918,29892,19786,29892,322,4094,325,26191,29889,1152,1342,29892,746,727,338,263,3287,310,4799,21180,918,297,278,25005,29892,372,508,14801,278,3578,297,1422,5837,29892,6820,278,14744,263,901,447,1537,470,13328,728,10097,29889,20175,29892,278,10122,310,19786,322,4094,325,26191,508,884,6602,278,982,278,3578,338,29574,29892,9819,297,263,1422,2927,310,278,14744,29889,13,13,3112,29915,29879,7088,451,292,393,278,7254,2927,310,278,14744,338,451,2337,4868,322,508,13100,8679,373,278,931,310,2462,29892,14826,5855,29892,322,4423,29889,1152,1342,29892,2645,6575,29878,895,322,6575,842,29892,278,14744,508,2125,373,298,1041,310,2654,29892,24841,29892,322,282,682,2861,304,278,10696,310,278,6575,4366,322,278,14801,292,310,3578,491,278,25005,29889],\"total_duration\":2982589696,\"load_duration\":14172844,\"prompt_eval_count\":26,\"prompt_eval_duration\":7905834,\"eval_count\":328,\"eval_duration\":2959379213}"

       "\"\\nThe sky appears blue because of a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. This occurs when sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere and encounters tiny molecules of gases such as nitrogen and oxygen. These molecules absorb some of the sunlight and scatter the rest in all directions, but they scatter shorter (blue) wavelengths more than longer (red) wavelengths.\\n\\nAs a result of this scattering, the blue light is dispersed throughout the atmosphere, giving the sky its characteristic blue color. The blue light can travel much farther through the atmosphere than the red light, which is why the sky appears blue from a distance even when the sun is high in the sky.\\n\\nIn addition to Rayleigh scattering, there are other factors that can affect the color of the sky. For example, dust and pollutants in the atmosphere can absorb certain wavelengths of light, making the sky appear more hazy or brownish. However, these effects are generally not as pronounced as the blue color caused by Rayleigh scattering.\\n\\nIt's worth noting that the exact shade of blue can vary depending on the time of day and atmospheric conditions. For example, during sunrise and sunset, the sky may take on a more orange or red hue due to the scattering of light by particles in the atmosphere.\""
