# Neural Network from Scratch with NumPy 🧠
This project implements a simple neural network using only the [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) library in Python
to recognize handwritten digit from [MNIST dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hojjatk/mnist-dataset).
The neural network is built manually, including phases such as optimization with gradient descent, forward propagation, and backpropagation.


## Installation 💻 (if you want to run it in local)
1. Clone the repository to your computer:
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
```bash 
python3 -m venv venv
```
3. Activate the virtual environment:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
4. Install the requirements:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage 📝
The `.ipynb` notebook it's ready for start, you just need to run it using your virtualenv or just upload it on
[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
