# Lab 04 - Object Detection and Image Segmentation üëÅ

In this lab lecture we are going to see how to use a pre-trained deep learning models with [Keras](https://keras.io/) and [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) libraries.
We are going to import and use a well known Image Classification Model [VGG16](https://pytorch.org/vision/main/models/generated/torchvision.models.vgg16.html)
both using Keras and Pytorch.
We are also using a [YOLO](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolov5/#supported-tasks-and-modes) network for Object Detection (using Pytorch)
and [DeepLabV3](https://pytorch.org/hub/pytorch_vision_deeplabv3_resnet101/) for Image Segmentation (using Pytorch).
