# Convolutional Neural Network 🔍

In this Lab lecture we will build, train, and evaluate a CNN model on CIFAR-10 dataset: a widely used benchmark with 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 classes.
We'll use tools Keras library to implement our models. CNNs excel in image data due to their unique architecture, featuring convolutional layers that detect spatial features in images. Unlike traditional neural
networks, CNNs reduce the dimensionality of data while maintaining critical information, making them ideal for image classification.
